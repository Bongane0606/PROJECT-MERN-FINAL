## Overview

SafeDrive Rewards is a web-based platform that leverages AI, IoT, and gamification to promote safe driving behaviors by rewarding drivers for responsible on-road actions. The app is designed for both individual drivers and fleet managers, offering real-time analytics, emergency response integration, and performance-based rewards.

This project showcases a modern front-end UI with responsive design, modal-based authentication, feature-rich tabbed sections, and dark mode support.
